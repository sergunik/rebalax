# Rebalax

Rebalax is an open-source automated portfolio rebalancer designed for managing dual-asset crypto portfolios (e.g. BTC and XAUT). The bot monitors price fluctuations and executes rebalancing operations when the asset allocation deviates beyond a configurable threshold (e.g. 7%).

It supports trading via centralized exchange APIs (e.g. Binance), converting assets through an intermediate stablecoin (USDT) to maintain an even 50/50 balance. The project is built with simplicity, transparency, and automation in mind â€“ ideal for long-term crypto holders who want to optimize their portfolio performance without daily micromanagement.
